               <h1>  ORIGIN OF INAWAYAN  </h1> 
               <p>
                Our journey began on June 28, 2006, in Elenita Heights, Cat Grande. Back then, we went through several names before finally finding the one that truly defined us. The road wasn’t easy—we struggled to make our presence known in the world of karate. Without a permanent training ground, we practiced wherever we could: playgrounds, open spaces, anywhere that had enough room for us to move. <br> But what we lacked in facilities, we made up for with passion and perseverance. Even in our first year as a team, we turned heads. Karate clubs across Mindanao and Visayas were surprised by our presence—no one knew who we were, but they quickly realized we weren’t easy to overlook.
                <br>Since that day, we’ve never stopped growing. We’ve faced obstacles, pushed through setbacks, and kept moving forward. Because for us, this isn’t just about karate—it’s about turning dreams into reality, one training session, one fight, and one victory at a time. </section>

                    At first glance, this flower is just simple, unappealing, and harmless. However, when you look at it and discover its characteristics, it will show a diversity of meanings. The three flowers symbolize the Flores sisters (the word Flores in Spanish is a flower ) and their corresponding contribution to the beauty of the art. However, despite its beauty alone, its thorns symbolize imminent danger; that shows not to underestimate its beauty because it could also fight and cause damage. This symbol stands as the Founder's legacy, Edilberto P. Flores, Shihan
